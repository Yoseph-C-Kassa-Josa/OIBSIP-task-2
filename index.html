                <p>As a trainee in the field of Software Engineering and computer programming, I have developed a strong foundation in various programming languages
                   such as Python, JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, React.js, React Native, Bootstrap and Tailwind frameworks. Moreover, I have taken courses on APIs and learned
                  how to fetch different information from various sources. My passion for creativity and strategic planning has led me to excel in developing websites.
                  To date, I have completed various paid website projects and tasks that can be solved or done by websites. For instance, I have developed <i>an MP4 mini music (Peru music) video </i>, 
                  which was converted by a website script (an automation script done by Python, CSS3, JavaScript, and HTML5) for a musician living in the USA, You can check scripts since source code is  public in my GitHub account.
                   Additionally, I have created a website for<i>LEGEND Engineering and Surveying PLC</i> , located in Addis Ababa. For more information, please refer to the projects section below.
                   My interest in website development has led me to aspire to become a full-stack developer. As I embark on my journey, I have established my own team, which focuses on website development.
                   Most of the team members are graduates from Harvard and MIT universities. My ultimate goal is to establish my own technology company that focuses on creating websites, apps, games, and
                    robotics inventions. I am particularly passionate about making a difference in Ethiopia and the world by teaching young people about technology and its potential to transform their lives and communities.
                  Throughout my career, I have been driven by a desire to learn and grow as a software engineer. I am committed to staying up-to-date with the latest trends and best practices in the field. I am confident that 
                  my skills, experience, and passion for technology will enable me to make a meaningful contribution to any organization I join and ultimately achieve my dream of creating a technology company that makes a difference in the world.</p>
